This is a diagram of PE runtime data structures created using WinDbg and OmniGraffle. I have included jpg and PDF versions in the repository.

I was inspired by Ero Carrera's [1] diagrams and Corkami [2]. I made this diagram because I was teaching myself Windows data structures and was unsatisfied with what was out there. The information for these structures was obtained from WinDbg and Windows Internals 6 by Russinovich, Solomon, and Ionescu [3].

I figured I should just upload it now instead of whenever I get around to finishing it. Hopefully I haven't made any mistakes. It will probably go through many iterations, maybe end up being interactive.
